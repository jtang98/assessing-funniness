# assessing-funniness
NLP project in a team of three people: Vadim BECQUET, JoÃ«l TANG, Victor TEMPE. The project was done in the context of a short MSc coursework.

In line with the challenge *Assessing the Funniness of Edited News Headlines (SemEval-2020)*, we describe some simple and more complex approaches to tackle with this task. Some of these methods use pre-trained embeddings, some not. These approaches are compared in their requirements, behaviour and performances.
